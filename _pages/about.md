I'm a Master's student at Dankook University in South Korea, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Seehwan Yoo](https://sites.google.com/site/dkumobileos/members/seehwanyoo) and [Jongmoo Choi](http://embedded.dankook.ac.kr/~choijm/) in the [System Software Laboratory](https://sslab.dankook.ac.kr/).

My research focuses on **ML for Systems** and **Systems for ML**, with specific emphasis on Learned Index. Here is my [CV](./assets/pdf/Minguk_Choi.pdf).

On-going projects:
  - **Semi-ordered Parallel Learned Index**: Enhances performance in multi-threaded environments by reducing the critical section and data sorting overhead while maintaining lookup performance and size
  - **Adaptive Sample Training Algorithm for Learned Index**: An algorithm for dynamically training with the optimal sampling interval by considering the data distribution and error-bound.
  - **Accelerating Learned Index via SIMD**: Accelerating the unique training and operations (e.g., model-biased insert) of learned index through the parallelism of internal ML models, which has not yet been actively studied.
