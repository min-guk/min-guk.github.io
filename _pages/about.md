Hello! üñê

I'm a Master's student at Dankook University in South Korea, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Seehwan Yoo](https://sites.google.com/site/dkumobileos/members/seehwanyoo) and [Jongmoo Choi](http://embedded.dankook.ac.kr/~choijm/) in the [System Software Laboratory](https://sslab.dankook.ac.kr/).

My research focuses on the exciting convergence of System and AI, with specific emphasis on **Learned Index** and **System for ML**. 

I am currently looking for **a PhD position for 2025** and expect to complete my Master's degree in August 2024!
