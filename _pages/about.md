I'm a Master's student at Dankook University in South Korea, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Seehwan Yoo](https://sites.google.com/site/dkumobileos/members/seehwanyoo) and [Jongmoo Choi](http://embedded.dankook.ac.kr/~choijm/) in the [System Software Laboratory](https://sslab.dankook.ac.kr/).

My research focuses on the exciting convergence of System and AI, with specific emphasis on **ML for Systems** and **Systems for ML**. Here is my [CV](https://min-guk.github.io/cv/).

On-going projects:
  - Adaptive Sample Training Algorithm for Learned Index
  - Accelerating Learned Index via SIMD
  - Semi-ordered Parallel Learned Index

##### **I am currently looking for a PhD position for 2025!**
