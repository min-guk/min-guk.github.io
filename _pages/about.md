I am researching in Korea under the remote supervision of [Professor Matthias Boehm](https://mboehm7.github.io/) at the Technical University of Berlin, Germany. 

Previously, I earned my Master's degree in August 2024 from Dankook University in Korea, where I had the privilege of being advised by Professors [Seehwan Yoo](https://sites.google.com/site/dkumobileos/members/seehwanyoo) and [Jongmoo Choi](http://embedded.dankook.ac.kr/~choijm/) in the [System Software Laboratory](https://sslab.dankook.ac.kr/).

My research focuses on **Systems for ML** and **ML for Systems**, with a particular emphasis on [Apache SystemDS](https://github.com/apache/systemds) and Learned Index. Here is my [CV](./assets/pdf/Minguk_Choi.pdf).

On-going projects:
  - **[Apache SystemDS](https://github.com/apache/systemds)**: An open-source ML system for the end-to-end data science lifecycle.
  - **Accelerating Learned Index via SIMD**: Accelerating learned indexes through the parallelism of internal ML models.
